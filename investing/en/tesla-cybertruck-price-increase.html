        <h1>Tesla raises Cybertruck price by fifteen thousand after adding self driving</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7567537/pexels-photo-7567537.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Tesla raises Cybertruck price by fifteen thousand after adding self driving - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Tesla raised the price of the Cyberbeast, the top-tier Cybertruck, by $15,000 in the United States, bringing its starting price to $114,990. The company made the increase when it introduced a new Luxe Package that is now standard on every Cyberbeast. Tesla says the package includes Supervised Full-Self Driving (FSD) capability and complimentary access to the Tesla Supercharger network.</p>
        <p>The price change affects only the Cyberbeast; the rest of the Cybertruck lineup in the U.S. remains unchanged. Tesla’s cheapest Cybertruck offering, the Long Range model, continues to start at $72,235. The announcement did not alter pricing for other trims, leaving the entry-level positioning intact while boosting the top-end sticker price.</p>
        <p>Sales data show the move comes as Cybertruck demand has underperformed company projections. Tesla sold 4,306 Cybertrucks in Q2 2025, a 12.6% decline from the same quarter in 2024. Total Cybertruck deliveries for 2024 were nearly 39,000 units, far short of Elon Musk’s earlier annual target of 500,000 units for the model. Those figures frame the price increase against a backdrop of softer-than-expected consumer uptake.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/9154182/pexels-photo-9154182.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Tesla raises Cybertruck price by fifteen thousand after adding self driving - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>Tesla has already used a series of demand-stimulation tactics for the Cybertruck, including trade-in offers, discounted financing, and launching lower-priced variants. Despite those measures, the model has faced persistent headwinds, such as its relatively high price points, reported recall issues, and missed delivery targets. These ongoing challenges have been cited by industry analysts as factors that have constrained the vehicle’s market performance.</p>
        <p>Making the Luxe Package standard on the Cyberbeast bundles FSD capability and Supercharger access into the base specification of the highest-priced trim. That reclassification raises the advertised starting price without altering lower-tier pricing. From a revenue perspective, bundling formerly optional features into a single, higher-priced configuration increases per-unit revenue on the top trim while preserving the advertised prices of other models.</p>
        <p>The timing of the increase, during a period of declining quarterly deliveries for the model, suggests Tesla is prioritizing margin on remaining premium purchases rather than broad-based volume growth. With the rest of the lineup unchanged, the company retains a lower-priced option for buyers more sensitive to sticker shock, while shifting additional feature costs to buyers who opt for the flagship trim.</p>
        <p>For buyers, the change alters the cost-benefit calculus of upgrading to the Cyberbeast. Buyers who value FSD capability and complimentary Supercharger access now face those features only through the higher-priced trim, rather than as add‑ons or optional packages. For buyers uninterested in those features, the unchanged Long Range starting price maintains a lower entry point into the Cybertruck line.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the price increase could produce two opposing effects. Higher per-unit revenue on the Cyberbeast could improve profitability on premium sales, but it may also further limit demand for the highest-priced trim in a segment where the model has already struggled to meet sales expectations. Continued reliance on promotions and lower-priced variants indicates Tesla recognizes the need to sustain volume, even as it experiments with margin-focused adjustments at the top end.</p>
        <p>Monitoring subsequent sales data will be key to assessing the outcome. If Cybertruck deliveries stabilize or rise while premium mix increases, Tesla’s pricing move may offset weaker volume. If premium demand contracts further, the company may need additional product, pricing, or incentive adjustments to narrow the gap between current sales and earlier production ambitions.</p>
