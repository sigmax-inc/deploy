        <h1>Tesla raises top Cybertruck price 15000 as luxury package becomes standard</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/28468161/pexels-photo-28468161.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Tesla raises top Cybertruck price 15000 as luxury package becomes standard - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Tesla raised the price of its top-tier Cybertruck variant, the Cyberbeast, by $15,000 in the United States, bringing its starting price to $114,990. The increase coincides with Tesla making a new Luxe Package standard on every Cyberbeast; the package includes Supervised Full-Self Driving (FSD) capability and complimentary access to Tesla’s Supercharger network. The rest of the Cybertruck lineup in the U.S. remains unchanged.</p>
        <p>The Cyberbeast is the only model to receive the new pricing and standard Luxe Package. Tesla’s cheapest Cybertruck offering, the Long Range model, continues to start at $72,235. Tesla said the Luxe Package would be included on Cyberbeast vehicles, while other trims were not mentioned in company statements summarized in recent coverage.</p>
        <p>Sales figures for the vehicle series have trailed initial projections. Tesla sold 4,306 Cybertrucks in Q2 2025, a 12.6% decline from the same quarter in 2024. Total Cybertruck deliveries for 2024 were nearly 39,000 units, well below CEO Elon Musk’s original target of 500,000 units per year. The model has also faced recall issues and missed delivery targets, factors that analysts say have weighed on demand.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/9775326/pexels-photo-9775326.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Tesla raises top Cybertruck price 15000 as luxury package becomes standard - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>Leading up to this price change, Tesla implemented several measures intended to stimulate sales, according to industry analysts. Those measures included trade-in offers, discounted financing, and the introduction of more affordable variants. Despite those moves, demand has not recovered to levels that meet Tesla’s earlier forecasts for the vehicle family.</p>
        <p>Analysts interpret the Cyberbeast price increase and the standardization of the Luxe Package as a shift in Tesla’s near-term commercial strategy for the model. Making FSD and Supercharger access standard raises the apparent value proposition for buyers at the top end but also increases the company’s effective content cost per vehicle if those features represent additional expense. By raising the sticker price only on the Cyberbeast, Tesla preserves lower entry prices on other trims while boosting revenue per unit at the high end.</p>
        <p>This adjustment can be read as an effort to capture higher-margin sales among buyers willing to pay for advanced features and convenience, rather than to expand volume. Industry observers noted Tesla has already sought volume through price cuts and financing incentives; the latest move contrasts with that approach by increasing price for the premium trim. The decision highlights a tension between volume-driven targets and margin preservation when a product underperforms against ambitious forecasts.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the implications for Cybertruck demand are mixed. If higher prices deter prospective buyers, the model could see further softness in deliveries; if the Luxe Package persuades a subset of buyers to upgrade, average transaction value could rise without improving volume. The wider Cybertruck program will likely remain under scrutiny given last year’s delivery shortfall and ongoing recall issues. Tesla’s subsequent pricing and incentive choices across trims will provide clearer signals about whether the company prioritizes margin recovery or volume growth for the model line.</p>
