        <h1>Apple Weighs Buying Mistral and Perplexity to Accelerate Its AI</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/11035469/pexels-photo-11035469.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Apple Weighs Buying Mistral and Perplexity to Accelerate Its AI - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Apple has held internal discussions about a potential acquisition of two artificial intelligence startups, Mistral and Perplexity, according to people cited by The Information. The talks reflect an effort to accelerate Apple’s AI strategy as the company faces pressure from competitors including Google, Microsoft and Samsung. No transaction has been announced and the conversations were reported to be internal, not public negotiations.</p>
        <p>The Information’s report attributes the disclosure to unnamed sources within Apple. The discussions come after CEO Tim Cook signaled last month that Apple is willing to consider larger AI-related acquisitions, a departure from the company’s historically conservative approach to mergers and acquisitions. Observers have increasingly highlighted Apple’s slower rollout of generative AI features on its devices as a strategic gap relative to rivals.</p>
        <p>Mistral is a French AI startup known for developing lightweight and open-weight language models. After its Series B funding round last year, Mistral was valued at over $6 billion, and recent reports have suggested it is seeking new financing at a $10 billion valuation. Those valuation figures underscore the capital intensity and market expectations surrounding advanced model developers.</p>

        <p>Perplexity is a U.S. company that positions itself as a competitor to traditional search engines and counts Nvidia and Jeff Bezos among its backers. Following the report of Apple’s internal discussions, Perplexity stated it was not aware of any merger conversations involving Apple, apart from its own announced acquisitions. Representatives for Apple, Mistral and Perplexity did not respond to requests for comment, and no deal has been finalized.</p>
        <p>The prospect of acquiring Mistral or Perplexity would address two different needs: access to advanced language models and search-oriented AI capabilities. Analysts cited in reporting say purchases of that kind could help Apple narrow the gap in generative AI and accelerate integration of those technologies into consumer devices and services. For Apple, the appeal lies in buying both talent and established model assets rather than building them entirely in-house.</p>
        <p>Several structural constraints inform the plausibility and potential impact of such acquisitions. Mistral’s rising reported valuation would make a purchase more costly and possibly dilutive to expected returns. Perplexity’s existing backers, including strategic investors, add complexity to any acquisition effort. More broadly, Apple’s traditional preference for internal development and selective, smaller acquisitions has shaped expectations about its willingness to complete large-scale deals.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Apple’s public statement of openness to larger AI-related acquisitions signals a strategic shift, but does not guarantee transactions. If Apple pursues acquisitions, target valuations and investor relationships will be central determinants of feasibility. Alternatively, Apple may intensify internal development to close the generative AI gap while remaining selective on external deals.</p>
        <p>Until parties confirm agreements, the situation remains a reported internal review rather than an executed strategy. The outcomes will influence Apple’s competitive position in AI-enabled products and services, and will be watched for their implications on how major tech companies compete to integrate advanced language models and search technologies into consumer ecosystems.</p>
