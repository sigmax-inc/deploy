        <h1>US opens audit into Tesla crash report delays linked to Autopilot</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/726233/pexels-photo-726233.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="US opens audit into Tesla crash report delays linked to Autopilot - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>U.S. federal safety regulators have opened a formal inquiry into delayed crash reports filed by Tesla for incidents involving its driver-assistance technologies, including Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) launched the probe after identifying multiple submissions that occurred several months or more after the underlying crashes, raising concerns about compliance with federal reporting rules.</p>
        <p>NHTSA’s action centers on requirements in a standing general order that mandates rapid reporting of crashes involving advanced driver-assistance or automated driving systems. Under that framework, agencies expect specified notifications to be submitted within one or five days of notice, depending on the incident type. The agency says several Tesla reports missed those windows, prompting further review.</p>
        <p>Both Tesla and NHTSA have attributed the delayed filings to a data collection issue at Tesla, and the company has said the problem has been resolved. NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation (ODI) has nonetheless escalated the matter by issuing an audit query to examine the origins and extent of the reporting delays, rather than treating the matter as a set of isolated clerical errors.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/797570/pexels-photo-797570.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="US opens audit into Tesla crash report delays linked to Autopilot - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>The ODI audit will assess whether Tesla’s mitigation steps adequately addressed the root cause, verify that all required data were included in previously submitted reports, and determine whether any crash reports remain outstanding. The audit aims to establish whether the tardy filings reflect a systemic problem in Tesla’s reporting processes and whether additional regulatory action is warranted to enforce compliance.</p>
        <p>Timely crash reporting is central to the regulator’s ability to detect safety trends and pursue interventions when automated driving systems show patterns of malfunction or misuse. Standing General Order 2021-01 specifically targets incidents involving advanced driver-assistance and self-driving functions because those systems can introduce novel failure modes that require prompt aggregation and analysis by safety authorities.</p>
        <p>The inquiry comes amid heightened oversight of Tesla’s driver-assistance programs. Regulators have been reviewing the safety of Full Self-Driving after a series of crashes, some fatal, and are concurrently monitoring Tesla’s recent launch of a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, along with company plans to enable self-driving capabilities in many vehicles through software updates. These developments increase the regulatory stakes for any shortcomings in how incident data are captured and reported.</p>
        <p>Tesla has not issued a public response to the latest investigatory developments. NHTSA’s audit could lead to different outcomes depending on its findings, including confirmation that the issue was isolated, identification of process or data gaps that require remediation, or further enforcement measures if noncompliance appears systemic. The agency’s immediate focus is on establishing the factual record and the completeness of past submissions.</p>
        <p>Next steps center on the ODI audit and any follow-up actions it mandates. The agency will determine whether additional documentation or corrected reports are necessary and whether Tesla’s corrective measures are sufficient. The outcome will influence both regulatory oversight of Tesla’s driver-assistance programs and the company’s ability to expand self-driving services in the U.S. while meeting federal safety reporting obligations.</p>
