        <h1>Davos CEOs struggle to turn AI pilots into reliable profits</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1466493/pexels-photo-1466493.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Davos CEOs struggle to turn AI pilots into reliable profits - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>At the 2025 World Economic Forum in Davos, artificial intelligence dominated discussions among business and government leaders, while company chiefs expressed uncertainty about converting the technology’s promise into sustained profits. Delegates framed AI as both a major opportunity and a practical management challenge, noting widespread interest but limited clarity on how to translate pilots into recurring revenue streams across industries.</p>
        <p>Over the course of the summit AI was described as the hottest topic, with panels and roundtables stressing its transformative potential alongside operational hurdles. Participants noted organizations are actively experimenting with models and tools, and senior executives repeatedly emphasized that public and private sectors must address both technical and organizational barriers before anticipated productivity gains are realized.</p>
        <p>Attendees reported that firms expect AI to lift productivity by up to 15–20 percent in the coming years, but many described the sector as still in a foundation-building phase. Pilots and prototypes were described as widespread; scaling those efforts consistently proved difficult. One executive summed the situation as “having developed copper wire but not yet inventing the light bulb,” underlining a gap between infrastructure and application-level value creation.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/33630731/pexels-photo-33630731.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Davos CEOs struggle to turn AI pilots into reliable profits - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>CEOs at closed-door roundtables focused on pragmatic concerns. They identified integration of AI into legacy operations as a core difficulty, citing the complexity of embedding models into decision workflows, compliance processes and customer-facing systems. Executives also raised workforce issues, highlighting the need for significant upskilling and the challenge of aligning talent development with rapidly evolving technical requirements.</p>
        <p>Participants further warned that the speed of technological change often outstrips employees’ ability to acquire new skills, creating a bottleneck for scaling. Firms reported difficulty in recruiting and training people who can operate and maintain AI systems at enterprise scale. This skills gap, executives said, increases the cost and time needed to move from experimental projects to reliable, revenue-generating deployments.</p>
        <p>Geopolitical dynamics emerged as another structural constraint. Rising tensions over technology governance, data restrictions and access to computing resources were cited as possible barriers to broader AI-driven transformation. Delegates warned that divergent national approaches to data flow and compute availability could fragment markets and complicate cross-border collaboration on research, standards and deployment.</p>
        <p>Sessions at Davos highlighted concrete applications—principally predictive maintenance in manufacturing and supply chains—that illustrated potential near-term returns. Yet these examples also reinforced the summit’s central theme: making AI pay at scale will require new strategies, cross-industry collaboration and substantial investment in both technology and people. Executives concluded that institutional change, ecosystem coordination and capital commitments are prerequisites for sustained value capture.</p>
        <p>The summit left a clear, pragmatic takeaway: optimism about AI’s long-term impact is widespread, but realizing economic value will demand hard work, continued experimentation and organizational commitment. CEOs at Davos emphasized that converting pilots into durable profits will be incremental, contingent on investments in skills, systems and governance, and sensitive to geopolitical constraints that could affect access to data and compute resources.</p>
