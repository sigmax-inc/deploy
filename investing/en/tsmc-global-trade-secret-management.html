        <h1>TSMC aims to export its trade secret vault to global partners</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/33667054/pexels-photo-33667054.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="TSMC aims to export its trade secret vault to global partners - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>TSMC is preparing to market a proprietary system for managing trade secrets to companies in Europe and the United States, the company’s associate general counsel said. The move aims to extend the tool beyond TSMC’s own operations to its suppliers and partners, positioning the system as an industry tool for systematic intellectual property management and controlled collaboration.</p>
        <p>The system was developed beginning in 2013 as a secure registry to catalogue and control access to confidential know‑how, technical processes and other evolving innovations. By the end of July 2025, TSMC had logged more than 610,000 entries into the registry, a mix of proprietary technologies and process know‑how. TSMC says the system is intended to support project tracking, joint developments and consistent protection across complex supply‑chain relationships.</p>
        <p>Adoption to date is limited but growing. About 20 Taiwanese firms, including ASE Technology Holding Co., have implemented the system. TSMC is now seeking to expand that footprint to major international partners and suppliers in Europe and the United States, pitching the tool as a way to reduce leakage risks and preserve technological advantages across an ecosystem of collaborators.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7230344/pexels-photo-7230344.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="TSMC aims to export its trade secret vault to global partners - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>Key technical features include integration with human resources and IT systems to enable robust tracking of trade secrets across personnel and projects; AI‑powered analytics to monitor usage, flag anomalies and automate protection workflows; and automatic file encryption with real‑time anomaly detection to strengthen cybersecurity and prevent misappropriation. TSMC frames these capabilities as both protective and facilitatory, allowing controlled internal access while maintaining strict auditability and safeguards.</p>
        <p>Structurally, TSMC’s initiative responds to the tension between secrecy and collaboration that characterizes modern semiconductor supply chains. Advanced process development increasingly requires joint work with equipment suppliers, foundry customers and materials partners, creating multiple points where sensitive knowledge can be exposed. A centralized, auditable registry that ties access controls to HR and IT records aims to make that exposure measurable and manageable rather than purely discretionary.</p>
        <p>The program’s timing reflects recent security incidents that highlighted the stakes. Prosecutors in Taiwan have indicted several individuals over the theft of TSMC’s advanced 2nm process technology, underscoring the continuing risk of intentional theft and the need for systematic corporate measures. TSMC presents the marketed system as a direct corporate response to those risks, intended to harden protections while supporting legitimate innovation activities.</p>
        <p>How the system will affect industry practice depends on uptake and interoperability. If major partners adopt the registry and integrate it with their own systems, the tool could standardize trade secret handling across a network of suppliers and customers and reinforce TSMC’s ecosystem advantages. Conversely, limited adoption or integration challenges would constrain its effectiveness as a cross‑firm solution.</p>
        <p>TSMC’s leadership argues that broader use will benefit all parties by strengthening innovation culture and safeguarding critical intellectual property. The company’s next steps—marketing to Europe and the United States and securing further partner integration—will determine whether the registry remains an internal control or becomes a de facto industry standard for trade secret management.</p>
