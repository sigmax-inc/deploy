        <h1>Trump claims Meta will spend 50 billion dollars on a Louisiana AI campus the size of Manhattan and Meta declines to confirm</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8097224/pexels-photo-8097224.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Trump claims Meta will spend 50 billion dollars on a Louisiana AI campus the size of Manhattan and Meta declines to confirm - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>On August 26, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump said Meta plans to spend $50 billion on a new artificial intelligence data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana. He announced the figure during a cabinet meeting and described a graphic comparing the project’s scale to Manhattan. Meta has not confirmed the $50 billion estimate and declined to comment on his remarks.</p>
        <p>Meta previously disclosed an initial investment exceeding $10 billion for the Louisiana facility and broke ground in December 2024. Industry reports in August cited a separate $29 billion financing arrangement involving investors such as PIMCO and Blue Owl Capital to support the expansion. In July, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the company would devote “hundreds of billions of dollars into compute to build superintelligence,” linking the site to Meta’s broader compute plans.</p>
        <p>Trump called the project “Hyperion” and said it would use enough power to supply about four million homes, with a footprint he compared to Manhattan. Reporting on the project describes a complex of nine buildings covering more than four million square feet and notes the site will support advanced AI workloads. Meta’s public statements have emphasized the center’s role in developing large AI models, but the company has not verified the $50 billion total.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1139312/pexels-photo-1139312.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Trump claims Meta will spend 50 billion dollars on a Louisiana AI campus the size of Manhattan and Meta declines to confirm - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>The numbers disclosed so far outline a rapid escalation in scale. The initial public commitment of more than $10 billion, the August financing reports totaling $29 billion, and the $50 billion figure cited by the president are distinct and not reconciled by Meta. That discrepancy leaves the total committed capital, the timing of disbursements, and the mix of Meta equity versus leveraged financing unclear based on currently available statements.</p>
        <p>Structurally, the Louisiana project represents a shift from conventional data-center builds toward integrated, at-scale compute campuses designed for generative AI training and inference. The site’s reported size, energy needs, and the company’s public emphasis on large-scale compute align with a strategy to internalize massive processing capability rather than rely on third-party cloud capacity. CEO comments about investing “hundreds of billions” into compute frame the facility as one piece of a much larger infrastructure push.</p>
        <p>Financially, the reported $29 billion investor arrangement, if accurate, suggests Meta is supplementing its own capital with external financing for the facility. The relationship between that financing and the $50 billion figure asserted by the president has not been made public. Meta’s decline to comment on the $50 billion claim leaves open whether the number refers to total project costs, broader regional investments, multi-year commitments, or a hypothetical upper bound presented internally.</p>
        <p>Operationally, a facility of the reported scale would involve sustained electricity demand and complex logistics. Reporting that the site could supply power equivalent to four million homes underscores the energy intensity of large AI training facilities. Those characteristics explain industry interest in site selection, grid capacity, and long-term operating costs for hyperscale AI infrastructure.</p>
        <p>If the $50 billion figure is verified, it would exceed previously disclosed figures and mark one of the largest single-site AI infrastructure commitments reported to date. Such a confirmation would likely intensify investor scrutiny and raise questions about financing structure, timelines for deployment, and regional impacts. For now, the project remains a focal point of Meta’s AI strategy, with public detail limited to past announcements, third-party reporting, and the president’s statement.</p>
