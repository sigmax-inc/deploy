        <h1>OpenAI chief people officer to leave for art and storytelling</h1>

        <p>OpenAI confirmed that Julia Villagra, its chief people officer, will leave the company this Friday. Villagra joined OpenAI in February 2024 as head of human resources and was promoted to chief people officer in March 2025 by CEO Sam Altman. The company framed the departure as a personnel change while assigning interim responsibilities to existing executives.</p>
        <p>OpenAI said Villagra is leaving to pursue a personal interest in using art, music and storytelling to help people understand the transition to artificial general intelligence. The company’s statements defined artificial general intelligence, or AGI, as AI systems capable of human-level intelligence and independent decision-making. Villagra did not respond to requests for comment and OpenAI declined to elaborate on a replacement.</p>
        <p>During the transition, Jason Kwon, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer, will assume Villagra’s duties. OpenAI said Fidji Simo, recently appointed CEO of applications, will be responsible for hiring a new chief people officer. The company provided no timetable for that search and declined to offer further comment beyond the personnel assignments.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4256852/pexels-photo-4256852.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="OpenAI chief people officer to leave for art and storytelling - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>Villagra’s background includes nearly 16 years as head of people at Hudson River Trading. OpenAI has recently hired several talent and HR professionals from that firm, a detail noted by the company in its personnel announcements. The movement of HR staff from a quantitative trading firm to OpenAI underscores the company’s ongoing effort to import experienced recruiters and human-resources operators.</p>
        <p>Her departure is the latest in a series of leadership moves at OpenAI. The company expanded its executive team months ago by appointing Fidji Simo as CEO of applications, a role that increased the company’s focus on product and application development. The reassignment of people responsibilities to senior executives indicates a temporary centralization of talent-management duties while a permanent replacement is sought.</p>
        <p>The exit occurs amid intensified competition for AI talent. OpenAI and rivals such as Meta have been active in recruiting top engineers and HR professionals, sometimes using large compensation packages. Reports and company statements also indicate that Meta has recently slowed some of its aggressive AI hiring, citing internal organizational planning, which has altered the external talent market dynamics to a degree.</p>
        <p>For OpenAI, the immediate operational question is how the interim arrangements affect retention and hiring while a chief people officer search is underway. Assigning duties to the chief strategy officer and the applications CEO short-circuits an external search in the very short term but leaves open when and how a dedicated people leader will be installed. The company’s refusal to provide further comment on timing or search criteria means key details on succession planning remain unresolved.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, outcomes of the CPO search and OpenAI’s ability to retain hires brought in from firms like Hudson River Trading will influence its capacity to compete for specialized AI talent. The broader labor market—shaped by rival hiring patterns and compensation practices—will also affect recruitment. Until OpenAI names a permanent chief people officer or provides more detail, the firm will operate under interim arrangements that reflect both leadership continuity and uncertainty in talent strategy.</p>
