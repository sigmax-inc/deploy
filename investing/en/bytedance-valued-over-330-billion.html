        <h1>ByteDance valued at over 330 billion after revenue tops Meta</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5081930/pexels-photo-5081930.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="ByteDance valued at over 330 billion after revenue tops Meta - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>ByteDance has launched an employee share buyback program that values the company at more than $330 billion, following a 25% year-on-year revenue increase in the second quarter of 2025. The company reported roughly $48 billion in revenue in that quarter, and its revenue for the first half of 2025 exceeded that of Meta Platforms, making ByteDance the largest social media company by sales for the period.</p>
        <p>Under the program, participating employees are being offered $200.41 per share. That price represents a 5.5% increase from a buyback six months earlier, when shares were purchased at $189.90 and the company was valued at $315 billion. The operation is framed internally as a standard liquidity and retention exercise tied to the firm’s recent financial performance.</p>
        <p>ByteDance’s second-quarter revenue of about $48 billion was driven largely by the Chinese market, according to company reporting. The 25% year-on-year rise contributed to the first-half outperformance versus Meta, a milestone that emphasizes ByteDance’s commercial scale even as its business mix remains heavily concentrated in Greater China.</p>
        <p>The share repurchase is also being used to address employee uncertainty in the U.S. ByteDance has faced sustained political and regulatory pressure there, with U.S. lawmakers considering measures that could force the company to divest TikTok’s American operations on national security grounds. Company discussions have included the possibility of a standalone U.S. app, but ByteDance has not set a long-term market structure for the United States.</p>
        <p>Despite revenue leadership, ByteDance’s valuation remains far below Meta’s $1.9 trillion market capitalization. Market participants and stakeholders point to political and regulatory risks, notably in the United States given TikTok’s Chinese ownership, as a principal constraint on a higher public-equity-style valuation for the private company.</p>
        <p>Structurally, ByteDance’s position reflects a tension between operating scale and geopolitical exposure. Strong top-line growth and cash generation support internal measures such as buybacks and employee incentives. At the same time, concentrated revenue in China and an unresolved regulatory overhang in the U.S. limit external repricing and complicate strategic options for maintaining global operations.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, ByteDance’s immediate financial momentum strengthens its standing among global tech firms, but near-term valuation and U.S. market access will depend on political outcomes and any concrete strategic moves on TikTok’s U.S. footprint. The company’s decisions on divestiture talks, a potential U.S.-specific app, and how it manages employee retention are likely to shape its commercial trajectory and investor perception.</p>
