        <h1>Amazon reportedly shifting Fire tablets to standard Android with higher price</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/20131200/pexels-photo-20131200.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Amazon reportedly shifting Fire tablets to standard Android with higher price - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Amazon is planning a major change to its Fire tablet software, moving away from its long-standing in-house forked operating system toward a version of standard Android, according to people familiar with the matter. The effort represents the company’s first significant departure from the custom Fire OS it has used since the tablet line launched in 2011 and signals a strategic reassessment of its tablet offering.</p>
        <p>The transition is described internally as project “Kittyhawk.” Sources say Amazon has begun engineering work on a Fire tablet that would run standard Android rather than Amazon’s forked variant. The first tablet under this program could appear as soon as next year, contingent on internal approval and execution decisions that remain under review by the company.</p>
        <p>Insiders expect Amazon to position the new device in a higher price tier than its current Fire tablets, targeting roughly $400 for the initial model. That planned price point is substantially above the existing retail range for Fire tablets, which typically sell between $60 and $230, reflecting an explicit intent to move upmarket rather than simply refresh lower-cost hardware.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/3756937/pexels-photo-3756937.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Amazon reportedly shifting Fire tablets to standard Android with higher price - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>The move responds to persistent criticism from users and developers about Fire OS’s limitations. Foremost among those complaints are restricted access to the Google Play Store and app compatibility problems when developers do not optimize for Amazon’s forked environment. These constraints have been cited as a barrier to adoption and a drag on the perceived value of Amazon’s tablet ecosystem.</p>
        <p>Technical details remain limited. Sources indicate Amazon would likely deploy a device based on the open-source components of Android rather than a Google-certified build. Using the open-source Android path can provide a more conventional Android experience but does not automatically include Google’s proprietary apps and services, which require separate agreements and certification.</p>
        <p>This effort coincides with a recent Amazon decision to shut down its Appstore for Android devices outside its own hardware. Company messaging about that closure and the Kittyhawk project together suggest a shift in how Amazon wants to control software distribution and platform relationships across devices it sells and supports.</p>
        <p>From a structural perspective, replacing a forked OS with a standard Android build addresses the core compatibility issue that has limited third-party app support. If Amazon succeeds in delivering broader app compatibility, it could improve the user experience and make Fire tablets more competitive with mainstream Android tablets from other manufacturers. However, absence of Google apps on an open-source Android build would still leave a gap relative to certified Android tablets that ship with Google Play and related services.</p>
        <p>There are material risks. Sources cautioned the project could be delayed or canceled for financial or strategic reasons. The higher target price implies greater expectations for margins and features, and those commercial calculations will influence Amazon’s willingness to proceed. Engineering, certification and potential negotiations with Google or app developers also present execution challenges.</p>
        <p>If Amazon moves forward and ships a higher-priced Fire tablet running standard Android, the company could narrow functional differences with tablets from Apple and Samsung. The scale of that impact will depend on whether Amazon includes Google services or secures equivalent app compatibility, how it prices and markets the product, and whether it continues to consolidate its app distribution strategy around its own hardware.</p>
