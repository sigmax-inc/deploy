        <h1>Musk Tried to Enlist Zuckerberg for 97 Billion OpenAI Buyout</h1>

        <p>Court filings in the litigation between OpenAI and Elon Musk show Musk sought Mark Zuckerberg’s help this year to finance a $97.4 billion bid by Musk’s AI startup xAI to acquire OpenAI. The communications surfaced in OpenAI’s papers and in sworn interrogations, and they have become a point of contention in discovery disputes between OpenAI and Meta.</p>
        <p>According to the filings, Musk discussed possible investment or financing arrangements with Zuckerberg and hoped Meta or Zuckerberg would join a consortium seeking control of OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT. Zuckerberg declined to participate, and neither he nor Meta signed the letter of intent that would have formalized their involvement. Those refusals are reflected in the filings OpenAI submitted to the court.</p>
        <p>OpenAI asked a federal judge to compel Meta to produce documents and communications related to any bid for OpenAI, including materials about potential restructuring or recapitalization. Meta’s legal team countered that such documents are irrelevant to the current dispute and urged that OpenAI seek any relevant materials directly from Musk and xAI. The parties’ disagreement centers on the scope of discoverable evidence about third-party outreach and financing efforts.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/15863044/pexels-photo-15863044.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Musk Tried to Enlist Zuckerberg for 97 Billion OpenAI Buyout - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>The outreach to Zuckerberg is embedded in a broader legal conflict that began after Musk, a 2015 OpenAI co‑founder who later founded xAI, grew critical of OpenAI’s shift toward a for‑profit structure and its partnership with Microsoft. In August 2024 Musk sued OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, alleging breach of contract and asserting that OpenAI favored business interests over its original commitment to benefit humanity. OpenAI filed a counterclaim, and a jury trial is scheduled for spring 2026.</p>
        <p>OpenAI has highlighted Musk’s approach to Zuckerberg as evidence supporting its contention that Musk’s attempted acquisition was a “sham” intended to injure OpenAI. That characterization appears in filings seeking broader discovery into who Musk contacted and how potential financiers responded. Meta’s refusal to produce documents, and its argument that the materials are irrelevant, has intensified the legal dispute over what third‑party negotiations must be disclosed.</p>
        <p>The filings illuminate the strategic aim behind the outreach: xAI sought major outside capital and at least one high‑profile partner to assemble a consortium capable of acquiring OpenAI. Zuckerberg’s refusal removed a potential source of financing and stripped the attempt of an influential ally, a fact OpenAI emphasizes in arguing the bid lacked legitimate backing. Those points are central to the parties’ competing narratives in court.</p>
        <p>The immediate legal consequence is a fight over discovery scope. If the judge compels Meta to produce communications, OpenAI could add third‑party responses to its evidentiary record; if not, OpenAI must rely on Musk’s own sworn testimony and any materials from xAI. Either outcome will affect how the jury sees the motives and feasibility of the proposed bid when trial begins.</p>
        <p>The dispute between Musk, OpenAI and third parties underscores friction among major tech firms as they compete in AI. The scheduled spring 2026 trial and ongoing discovery will determine whether the outreach to Zuckerberg becomes decisive evidence of intent or remains a peripheral episode in a broader contractual and corporate battle.</p>
