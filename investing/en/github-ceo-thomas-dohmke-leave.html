        <h1>GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke to leave and found a new startup</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/33667054/pexels-photo-33667054.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke to leave and found a new startup - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>GitHub Chief Executive Officer Thomas Dohmke announced he will step down at the end of 2025 to found a new startup, concluding nearly four years leading the Microsoft-owned code-hosting platform. Dohmke became CEO in late 2021 and says he will remain through 2025 to support a planned leadership transition.</p>
        <p>During his tenure, GitHub increased its emphasis on artificial intelligence and released GitHub Copilot, an AI coding assistant the company says is used by approximately 20 million developers. The period since late 2021 saw what the company describes as rapid growth and pivotal innovation, with Copilot as the most prominent product tied to that shift.</p>
        <p>Under Dohmke’s leadership GitHub expanded its scale, hosting 1 billion repositories and forks and serving a community of more than 150 million developers. The company moved toward a remote-first engineering model that Dohmke cited as a source of pride in his announcement. He framed his departure as a return to entrepreneurial roots, writing, “After all this time, my startup roots have begun tugging on me and I've decided to leave GitHub to become a founder again.”</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/7857551/pexels-photo-7857551.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke to leave and found a new startup - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>Microsoft disclosed that it will not appoint a new GitHub CEO after Dohmke’s departure. Instead, GitHub’s leadership will report directly to several Microsoft executives and will be more closely integrated with Microsoft’s CoreAI division. Microsoft framed this restructuring as a step to further embrace AI within its ecosystem and to continue supporting the developer community.</p>
        <p>The repositioning aligns GitHub’s organizational reporting with Microsoft’s broader AI initiatives. By eliminating a standalone CEO role and routing oversight through multiple Microsoft executives and CoreAI, the company will be subject to closer strategic coordination with Microsoft’s central AI programs. That structure reduces GitHub’s standalone executive autonomy while embedding it more tightly in Microsoft’s AI agenda.</p>
        <p>Competition in the AI-assisted development space factored into GitHub’s recent product strategy. The company expanded Copilot and related projects amid rising industry competition from firms such as Google and Cursor, indicating a market dynamic that favors rapid feature development and broader platform integration.</p>
        <p>Dohmke also cast the AI era as a major opportunity for software creation, predicting a “new gold rush of software” and anticipating billions of AI agents enabling a larger population of developers. He has not disclosed details about the startup he plans to found, limiting public insight into his next focus or into how his departure might influence product priorities at GitHub.</p>
        <p>For developers, enterprises, and partners, the immediate implications are twofold: GitHub will remain under Microsoft’s ownership but with altered governance, and product roadmaps may shift to reflect deeper integration with Microsoft’s CoreAI priorities. The change could accelerate AI-driven feature rollouts but also raises questions about how independent product decisions will be handled.</p>
        <p>The transition period through the end of 2025 offers Microsoft time to implement the new reporting structure and for GitHub to align operationally with CoreAI. Observers should watch for announcements detailing the precise mechanics of oversight, the allocation of engineering resources to AI initiatives, and any public statements from Dohmke about his startup to gauge longer-term impacts on GitHub and the developer ecosystem.</p>
