        <h1>TSMC unveils system to protect trade secrets for global suppliers</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/33667054/pexels-photo-33667054.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="TSMC unveils system to protect trade secrets for global suppliers - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) is preparing to market a proprietary system for managing trade secrets to companies in Europe and the United States, the company’s associate general counsel said. The initiative is presented as a tool for TSMC, its suppliers and partners to strengthen intellectual property governance across the semiconductor supply chain while supporting innovation within security protocols.</p>
        <p>TSMC began developing the trade-secrets management system in 2013. The system operates as a secure registry for cataloguing confidential know-how, technical processes and evolving innovations, and by the end of July 2025 it had logged more than 610,000 entries, according to the associate general counsel. The company frames the registry as a platform for tracking and controlling access to high-value information over time.</p>
        <p>Adoption to date has been limited but notable: about 20 Taiwanese firms, including ASE Technology Holding Co., have implemented the system. TSMC has signalled an intention to extend the offering to major international partners and suppliers in Europe and the United States, positioning the product as both a protective measure and an interoperability standard for members of its wider ecosystem.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/1474993/pexels-photo-1474993.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="TSMC unveils system to protect trade secrets for global suppliers - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>Functionally, the system is described as a centralised index that ties specific trade secrets to projects, personnel and joint developments, enabling controlled internal access and audit trails. The registry is intended to document evolving technical knowledge so that ownership and permitted use can be defined and enforced across collaborative workstreams without relying on ad hoc agreements or siloed records.</p>
        <p>The system also integrates technical controls. TSMC says it has linked the registry with human resources and information-technology systems to track who touches particular trade secrets and when. It incorporates AI-powered analytics to monitor usage patterns, flag anomalies and automate certain protection workflows, and it applies automatic file encryption alongside real-time anomaly detection to reduce the risk of accidental disclosure or deliberate theft.</p>
        <p>TSMC frames the system as more than a defensive mechanism. Company officials state the design aims to make trade secrets accessible within defined security boundaries so that collaborators can use proprietary knowledge where appropriate, rather than isolating information entirely. The registries and access controls are intended to balance secrecy with the operational need for productive collaboration across supply-chain partners.</p>
        <p>The push to formalise trade-secret management follows high-profile security incidents that highlighted the risks companies face. Prosecutors in Taiwan have indicted several individuals over the theft of TSMC’s advanced 2 nm process technology, an episode TSMC and observers cite to underline the commercial and national-security stakes involved in protecting semiconductor know-how.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, TSMC is seeking broader adoption among international suppliers and partners and argues that standardised trade-secret governance will benefit the whole ecosystem by preserving technological advantages and supporting an innovation culture. The company positions the system as a way to reinforce its competitive position while reducing information-risk across complex supplier networks.</p>
