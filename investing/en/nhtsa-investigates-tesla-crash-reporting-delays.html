        <h1>US regulators probe Tesla over delayed crash reports for Autopilot</h1>

        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has opened an inquiry into delays by Tesla in reporting crashes involving its driver-assistance systems, including Autopilot and Full Self-Driving. The probe targets the timing of incident notifications and whether Tesla met federal reporting obligations for crashes tied to advanced driver-assistance or self-driving technologies.</p>
        <p>NHTSA initiated the inquiry after identifying instances in which Tesla filed multiple crash reports several months or more after the events occurred. Federal rules referenced by the agency require such reports to be submitted within one or five days of notice, depending on the circumstance. The incidents implicated are subject to NHTSA Standing General Order 2021-01, which governs reporting for vehicles equipped with advanced driver-assistance or automated driving features.</p>
        <p>Both Tesla and NHTSA have said the delayed filings stemmed from a data collection issue within the company. Tesla has told regulators that the problem has been resolved. Beyond that attribution, the agency has moved to verify the explanation and to establish whether the delays represent isolated errors or a broader reporting failure.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5561922/pexels-photo-5561922.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="US regulators probe Tesla over delayed crash reports for Autopilot - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>NHTSA’s Office of Defects Investigation has issued an audit query to examine the cause and scope of the late reports. The audit will assess Tesla’s mitigation measures, verify whether the reports included all required data, and determine if any incident reports remain outstanding. The ODI intends to establish whether the late reporting was systemic and whether additional enforcement or corrective measures are warranted.</p>
        <p>The timing of the audit coincides with heightened regulatory scrutiny of Tesla’s driver-assistance programs. The company recently launched a robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, and has announced plans to enable self-driving capabilities in many existing vehicles through software updates. Those developments have increased the regulatory stakes associated with timely and complete crash reporting.</p>
        <p>NHTSA is also pursuing separate investigations into the safety of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving system after a series of crashes, some of which resulted in fatalities. Those ongoing probes and the current audit into reporting practices represent multiple regulatory threads focused on Tesla’s approach to deploying automated driving functions and documenting incidents involving them.</p>
        <p>Tesla has not issued a public response to the latest investigatory developments. The company’s prior communications to NHTSA attributing delays to a data collection issue are on record, but the agency’s audit seeks independent confirmation and a fuller picture of any reporting gaps.</p>
        <p>The regulatory rationale for strict reporting timelines is to enable timely oversight, pattern detection, and risk assessment. Delays in filing required crash reports can impede regulators’ ability to identify safety trends, prioritize investigations, and issue safety directives. The ODI audit will test whether the delays disrupted those oversight functions and whether Tesla’s corrective steps are sufficient.</p>
        <p>The outcome of the audit could affect Tesla’s regulatory standing and its roadmap for expanding self-driving services in the United States. If NHTSA finds systemic noncompliance or incomplete reporting, the agency could pursue enforcement actions or require further remedies. The audit’s findings will therefore bear directly on Tesla’s deployment of advanced driving features and on regulatory scrutiny going forward.</p>
