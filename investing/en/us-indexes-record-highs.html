        <h1>Major US indexes hit records as Nvidia fuels AI driven rally</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/343239/pexels-photo-343239.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Major US indexes hit records as Nvidia fuels AI driven rally - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>The S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at record highs after a trading session led by strong corporate earnings from Nvidia that reinforced momentum in the artificial intelligence sector. Nvidia reported a 56% surge in revenue, a result markets interpreted as confirmation of robust and growing demand for AI-related technologies. That earnings outcome underpinned a broad risk-on move across major U.S. equity indices.</p>
        <p>In sequence, Nvidia released its results, citing the 56% revenue increase, and the company’s performance quickly influenced market sentiment. Technology names that provide AI infrastructure and services rose, with Amazon, Alphabet, and Broadcom among those registering gains during the session. The optimistic response extended to the Nasdaq, which rose by more than 0.5% as investors reweighted expectations for technology earnings and growth.</p>
        <p>Market breadth during the session favored large-cap technology and other economically sensitive sectors linked to AI deployment. The S&P 500 and the Dow achieved record closing levels as investors concentrated on forward-looking revenue signals embedded in Nvidia’s report. Trading volumes and intraday volatility were consistent with a market responding to a single dominant earnings narrative rather than a broad-based macro shock.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/159888/pexels-photo-159888.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Major US indexes hit records as Nvidia fuels AI driven rally - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>Despite the overall positive market reaction, Nvidia’s share price dipped slightly during the session. Market participants attributed that move to ongoing trade tensions with China, a point cited alongside the earnings headline. The pullback in Nvidia’s stock underscores a separation between company-level fundamentals tied to AI demand and geopolitically driven risks that can affect supply chains, customer access, and investor appetite for exposure to specific firms.</p>
        <p>Structurally, the market reaction reflects two interacting forces. First, confirmation of accelerating AI-related revenue at a leading supplier reinforces expectations that a subset of technology firms will deliver outsized growth compared with the broader economy. Second, the persistence of geopolitical and policy risks—here summarized by trade tensions with China and the potential for tariff changes—introduces offsetting downside scenarios. Investors appear to be pricing a higher premium for AI-driven growth while maintaining sensitivity to external shocks.</p>
        <p>The current pricing environment therefore concentrates value on firms perceived as direct beneficiaries of AI investment, while leaving broader market valuations exposed to shifts in policy and international relations. Financial markets are treating Nvidia’s results as both a sectoral catalyst and a test case for how corporate earnings can overcome, at least temporarily, non-economic headwinds. That duality explains why indexes can reach record levels even as individual securities experience pressure from geopolitical developments.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the most immediate sources of risk identified by market analysts remain macroeconomic and policy-related. Tariff policy adjustments and future Federal Reserve decisions were singled out as potential drivers of volatility in coming months. Continued positive earnings from AI-linked companies could sustain the rally, but the persistence and direction of policy risks will likely determine how durable those gains prove to be.</p>
        <p>Investors and policymakers will likely focus on subsequent earnings reports from other major technology firms and any developments in trade relations with China, as well as signals from the Federal Reserve. Those factors will influence whether the current AI-led advance broadens across sectors or contracts in response to policy-induced volatility.</p>
