        <h1>Federal Circuit Revives Sonos Patents and 32.5 Million Verdict Against Google</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/5511714/pexels-photo-5511714.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Federal Circuit Revives Sonos Patents and 32.5 Million Verdict Against Google - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit revived key patent claims for Sonos and reinstated a jury verdict against Google, marking a significant shift in the companies’ long-running dispute over smart speaker technology. The appeals court overturned portions of a lower court decision that had invalidated Sonos’s patents and nullified a monetary award, restoring Sonos’s ability to enforce the patents at issue.</p>
        <p>Sonos filed suit against Google in 2020, alleging infringement of patents related to grouping wireless speakers and creating “overlapping zone scenes” that let users control multiple speakers across rooms. A jury found Google liable and awarded Sonos $32.5 million. That verdict became central to the dispute and set the stage for a broader judicial examination of Sonos’s patent prosecution history and claim amendments.</p>
        <p>District Judge William Alsup later ruled the patents unenforceable on the ground of prosecution laches, an equitable defense applied when a patentee unreasonably delays in asserting patent rights. Judge Alsup concluded Sonos had added new claims after Google introduced the accused products and that the timing amounted to an abuse of the patent process, leading him to invalidate the patents and set aside the jury award.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/33669072/pexels-photo-33669072.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Federal Circuit Revives Sonos Patents and 32.5 Million Verdict Against Google - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>On appeal the Federal Circuit disagreed with the district court’s application of prosecution laches, limiting the doctrine’s scope to rare cases of egregious misuse. The appeals court emphasized that a lengthy prosecution history, including Sonos’s 13-year continuation of the patent family, does not automatically constitute laches. The court also held that a defendant asserting laches bears the burden of proving it suffered concrete prejudice from the delay.</p>
        <p>The Federal Circuit found Google had not met that burden and accordingly restored Sonos’s patents and the jury’s $32.5 million award. By reversing the district court, the appeals court reinstated the legal basis for Sonos to press infringement claims tied to the restored patents and preserved the monetary judgment determined by the jury.</p>
        <p>Legally, the decision narrows the circumstances in which courts will apply prosecution laches to render patents unenforceable. The opinion reinforces that prejudice to the accused infringer must be shown and that prosecutorial delay alone is insufficient. This raises the evidentiary bar for defendants who seek to use equitable defenses based on delay rather than contesting patent validity or noninfringement on the merits.</p>
        <p>Practically, the ruling strengthens Sonos’s enforcement position. With patents and the jury award reinstated, Sonos can pursue further remedies against Google for products that incorporate the technologies covered by the restored claims. The company also gains leverage in potential licensing discussions tied to the disputed grouping and synchronization features.</p>
        <p>The Federal Circuit’s decision will influence ongoing litigation strategy and the posture of both parties going forward. By clarifying the limited reach of prosecution laches and requiring proof of prejudice, the ruling may affect how courts and litigants approach patent prosecution histories and equitable defenses in future technology disputes.</p>
