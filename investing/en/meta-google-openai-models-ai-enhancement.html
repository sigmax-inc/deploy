        <h1>Meta eyes Google and OpenAI models to quickly boost its AI</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/8097224/pexels-photo-8097224.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Meta eyes Google and OpenAI models to quickly boost its AI - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Meta’s top AI executives have discussed using models from Google and OpenAI inside Meta’s apps to bolster the company’s AI features, according to recent reporting by The Information. The conversations involve Meta’s new unit, Meta Superintelligence Labs, and center on integrating external models to improve Meta AI, the company’s primary chatbot, and other AI-driven functions across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.</p>
        <p>The Information reports that Meta Superintelligence Labs considered incorporating Google’s Gemini to deliver advanced conversational, text-based responses for Meta AI. Company leaders also evaluated using OpenAI’s models as a source of capability for Meta AI and for other in-product AI features. Insiders framed these options as interim measures rather than long-term licensing partnerships with competitors.</p>
        <p>Separately, Meta already uses third-party models for some internal tools. The reporting notes that employees can use Anthropic’s models in an internal coding assistant, indicating existing operational experience with external providers and a precedent for incorporating third-party models into workflows and tooling.</p>

        <p>Sources tell The Information that Meta’s motivation is to raise product sophistication while it develops its own models. One stated company priority is ensuring the forthcoming Llama 5 model will be competitive with rival offerings. The reported talks with Google and OpenAI are portrayed internally as ways to shorten the gap between current product quality and the capabilities Meta expects from its next-generation in-house models.</p>
        <p>A Meta spokesperson told The Information, “We are taking an all-of-the-above approach to building the best AI products; and that includes building world-leading models ourselves, partnering with companies, as well as open sourcing technology.” The company framed partnerships with outside model providers as one element among several in its broader AI strategy. The spokesperson’s comment reiterates Meta’s hybrid approach but does not confirm concrete deals.</p>
        <p>The Information notes that OpenAI, Google, and Microsoft—which is a backer of OpenAI—had not publicly responded to requests for comment about these internal discussions. The absence of public statements leaves the reports limited to The Information’s sourcing and Meta’s own general description of strategy. There is no reporting in the cited accounts of executed contracts or finalized technical integrations.</p>
        <p>Structurally, the reported discussions reflect a pragmatic trade-off between speed and autonomy. Using external models can accelerate feature deployment and improve user-facing performance quickly, but it creates reliance on competitors’ technology and may complicate product differentiation. Meta’s internal use of third-party models suggests the company aims to gain short-term capability while continuing to invest in Llama 5 and other proprietary assets.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, the most concrete signal from the reporting is Meta’s continued internal priority on Llama 5 and the company’s stated preference for multiple development routes: in-house modeling, partnerships, and open source. If Meta follows the path described by insiders, any integration of Google or OpenAI models would likely be temporary and focused on specific feature gaps until Llama 5 or other internal models meet the company’s performance targets.</p>
