        <h1>ByteDance valued over 330 billion after buyback as revenue beats Meta</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/590011/pexels-photo-590011.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="ByteDance valued over 330 billion after buyback as revenue beats Meta - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>ByteDance has launched an employee share buyback program that places the company’s valuation at over $330 billion, following a 25% year-on-year revenue increase in the second quarter of 2025. The company reported revenue that exceeded Meta Platforms, Inc. for the first half of the year, a milestone that positions ByteDance as the world’s largest social media company by sales for that period.</p>
        <p>Under the buyback, participating employees are being offered $200.41 per share. That price represents a 5.5% increase from a repurchase six months earlier, when shares were bought at $189.90 and the company’s private valuation was approximately $315 billion. The program repeats the company’s use of internal liquidity to provide liquidity and reaffirm internal valuations.</p>
        <p>ByteDance reported approximately $48 billion in revenue in the second quarter alone, a figure that reflects the 25% year-on-year growth cited by the company. Company disclosures indicate the bulk of that revenue was generated in the Chinese market, although the firm did not publish a full regional breakdown in the material summarized here.</p>
        <p>For the first half of the year, ByteDance’s total revenue surpassed that of Meta, a comparison frequently used to assess scale in social media. The crossover in sales underscores ByteDance’s rapid commercial expansion, particularly in advertising and its core content platforms, and it has been highlighted internally and externally in recent company communications.</p>
        <p>The buyback has a personnel retention element. ByteDance has said the repurchase is intended in part to support morale among U.S.-based employees who have faced uncertainty amid discussions in Washington about forcing the company to divest TikTok’s American operations on national security grounds. Proposals to require a sale of the U.S. unit have been under consideration by U.S. lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Reports also indicate ByteDance has explored developing a standalone app for the U.S. market as an alternative to operating the existing TikTok platform under current ownership. The company’s long-term strategy for its U.S. business remains unclear in public accounts, and no final decisions on structural changes have been disclosed in the material summarized here.</p>
        <p>Despite the revenue milestone, ByteDance’s valuation remains well below Meta’s market capitalization of $1.9 trillion. Market participants and analysts cited in recent reporting attribute much of that valuation gap to political and regulatory risks, especially in the United States, where concerns about Chinese ownership and data security have driven debate and potential policy actions.</p>
        <p>The concentration of revenue in China is another structural factor shaping investor assessments. Heavy reliance on a single market exposes ByteDance to domestic regulatory shifts while regulatory uncertainty in the U.S. adds a second vector of risk. The employee buyback functions as a tactical response to those pressures by reinforcing internal value and addressing immediate retention concerns.</p>
        <p>Near-term effects of the repurchase are likely to be confined to employee morale and internal valuation signals. Longer-term outcomes for ByteDance’s market valuation and its U.S. operations will hinge on political developments in Washington and on any strategic decisions the company makes about a standalone U.S. product or divestment. Geopolitical and regulatory risks will remain the primary constraints on ByteDance’s public-market comparability.</p>
