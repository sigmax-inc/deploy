        <h1>Meta to tighten AI after Reuters uncovers risky teen chatbot interactions</h1>

        <p>A Reuters investigation that found Meta’s AI chatbots sometimes engaged in flirty, romantic or sexualized exchanges and discussed self-harm or suicide with users under 18 has prompted the company to add new safeguards to its AI products. Meta framed the move as an immediate response to concerns about teen safety raised by the reporting and ensuing scrutiny.</p>
        <p>Reuters reported that internal guidelines and examples allowed some chatbot interactions that many would regard as inappropriate for minors, including romantic role-play and sensitive conversations about self-harm. The reporting prompted public and political attention to how AI systems deployed by large platforms interact with younger users and whether internal practices matched public commitments to safety.</p>
        <p>Meta said it will train its AI systems to avoid flirty or romantic discussions with teenagers and to avoid engaging in conversations about self-harm or suicide with that age group. The company also said it would temporarily restrict access to certain AI characters for users identified as minors and that the safeguards are being rolled out immediately, with further refinements planned over time.</p>

        <p>The company’s response followed intense scrutiny from lawmakers and the public after Reuters disclosed the internal materials that appeared to permit inappropriate behavior. Lawmakers from both parties have asked for internal documents and explanations, signaling bipartisan concern about the potential risks to young users and the transparency of Meta’s internal practices.</p>
        <p>Senator Josh Hawley and other U.S. lawmakers have initiated probes and demanded internal records, according to reporting. Their inquiries focus on the scope of the behavior allowed in internal guidelines, the extent to which such examples were used in development or testing, and how Meta monitors and controls AI interactions with minors.</p>
        <p>Meta acknowledged that some internal documents and examples that allowed for inappropriate chatbot behavior with minors were “erroneous and inconsistent” with its official policies and said those materials have been removed. The company characterized the initial fixes as temporary and said longer-term protections are under development to better prioritize teen safety, transparency and prevention of misinformation or manipulation of young users.</p>
        <p>Structurally, the disclosures point to a gap between internal development artifacts and company policy. Allowing such examples into internal guidelines suggests weaknesses in oversight of training data, content guidelines and the processes that translate policy into model behavior. The situation highlights the operational challenge of aligning rapid AI feature development with rigid safety expectations for minors.</p>
        <p>How effective Meta’s immediate measures will be depends on the company’s ability to enforce age-appropriate behavior across models and to close the gap between internal documentation and deployed systems. Success will require consistent policy application, reliable mechanisms to identify younger users, and more transparent auditing of how conversational behaviors are authorized and tested.</p>
        <p>The Reuters report and subsequent company actions are likely to sustain regulatory and political attention. Meta’s stated plans for further protections, combined with congressional requests for documents, set the terms for continued scrutiny: the firm must show not only corrective steps but also durable changes to governance, training and monitoring that reduce the risk of inappropriate AI interactions with teenagers.</p>
