        <h1>Alibaba develops AI chip to run models and reduce Nvidia reliance</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/30855423/pexels-photo-30855423.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Alibaba develops AI chip to run models and reduce Nvidia reliance - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Alibaba has developed a new AI chip intended to reduce China’s reliance on Nvidia for AI applications, the Wall Street Journal reported. The processor is designed for AI inference—serving trained models in production—which requires less compute than model training. Alibaba positions the chip as more versatile than its prior Hanguang 800 product and capable of handling a broader set of inference tasks, including those used in modern language and image generation models.</p>
        <p>Chronologically, the effort followed U.S. export restrictions on advanced AI hardware. U.S. rules earlier this year blocked sales of Nvidia’s H20 AI processor in China, prompting Chinese companies to accelerate domestic alternatives. Although the U.S. later allowed H20 sales to resume, Alibaba and other firms continued development of replacement processors. Previously Alibaba’s AI chips were manufactured by TSMC; the new processor, according to reports, is produced by a Chinese foundry.</p>
        <p>Alibaba’s chip is reported to be compatible with Nvidia’s popular software platforms, enabling engineers to repurpose existing code and reduce integration work when switching hardware. That technical choice aims to lower barriers for developers using Alibaba’s cloud services and to offer continuity for enterprise customers that depend on Nvidia ecosystems. The company is already a major Nvidia customer and is China’s largest cloud provider.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/33603862/pexels-photo-33603862.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Alibaba develops AI chip to run models and reduce Nvidia reliance - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>The new processor targets inference rather than training. Inference hardware typically requires lower raw compute and different architectural trade-offs than training accelerators, making local development and deployment more achievable under supply constraints. Alibaba’s explicit focus on inference aligns with practical industry demand: serving models in production is a widespread, immediate need distinct from the high-end training workloads that have driven demand for Nvidia’s most advanced chips.</p>
        <p>Structurally, the move reflects a combination of government-driven and market-driven incentives. Beijing’s emphasis on a self-sufficient domestic AI supply chain under U.S. export controls creates strategic pressure for Chinese cloud providers and chipmakers to internalize key components. Simultaneously, market signals—evidenced by Alibaba Cloud’s reported 26% revenue increase in the April–June quarter—create commercial incentives to offer proprietary hardware that can capture cloud workloads and differentiate services.</p>
        <p>The compatibility approach reduces switching costs and mitigates developer friction, while domestic manufacturing addresses geopolitical risk in supply. However, targeting inference leaves open the question of whether and when China will field domestic training accelerators that match Nvidia’s top-tier performance. The reported use of a Chinese foundry for this processor indicates prioritization of supply-chain sovereignty over reliance on foreign fabrication at this stage.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Alibaba’s chip is likely to influence cloud competition and procurement choices in China by providing an onshore alternative for inference workloads and preserving software continuity for customers. Continued U.S. export policy shifts and Nvidia’s product availability will affect adoption dynamics. For Alibaba and other Chinese firms, the near-term objective is to secure production and ecosystem compatibility for inference tasks; the longer-term trajectory will depend on progress toward higher-performance training hardware and on how quickly software ecosystems adapt to heterogeneous accelerators.</p>
