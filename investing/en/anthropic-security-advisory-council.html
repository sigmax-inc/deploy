        <h1>Anthropic unveils bipartisan security council to advise on government AI</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/33630731/pexels-photo-33630731.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Anthropic unveils bipartisan security council to advise on government AI - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Anthropic has formed a National Security and Public Sector Advisory Council to guide the integration of its artificial intelligence into sensitive government and defense uses. The company says the council comprises a bipartisan group of senior figures from intelligence, defense, energy and justice sectors. Anthropic positions the council as a mechanism to advise on public-sector deployments and to help shape safety, security and ethical standards for government applications of its technology.</p>
        <p>The council brings together former senior officials and technical leaders with relevant sectoral experience. Named members include Roy Blunt, a former U.S. senator and intelligence committee member; David S. Cohen, a former deputy director of the CIA; Lisa Gordon-Hagerty and Jill Hruby, both former heads of the National Nuclear Security Administration; Dave Luber, a former NSA cybersecurity director; and Patrick Shanahan, a former deputy secretary of defense. Anthropic has indicated it will add members as public-sector work expands.</p>
        <p>Anthropic describes three core advisory functions: to counsel the company on deploying models such as Claude in government, defense and national security contexts; to help set standards for AI safety, security, ethics and regulatory compliance in public-sector applications; and to ensure advanced AI supports democratic interests and helps maintain the technological lead of the U.S. and its allies amid competition with China and Russia. Those objectives frame the council’s remit toward both operational deployment and governance.</p>

        <p>The council’s launch follows Anthropic’s $200 million contract with the U.S. Department of Defense to develop AI tools for defense, a deal that places Anthropic alongside competitors that have also secured government work. Companies such as OpenAI, Google and xAI have won similar government contracts. Anthropic says the creation of a dedicated national security advisory body differentiates it from rivals by formalizing external, senior-level input on sensitive engagements.</p>
        <p>The advisory group is expected to focus on domains where government use of advanced AI carries high operational and strategic impact. Anthropic and analysts cited by the company point to cybersecurity, intelligence analysis and scientific research as primary areas where guidance could shape both technical requirements and acceptable use policies. The council is also described as a forum for reconciling technical capabilities with legal, ethical and security constraints specific to public-sector missions.</p>
        <p>Structurally, the council embeds external expertise into Anthropic’s public-sector strategy. By assembling former policymakers, intelligence officials and technical leaders, Anthropic gains a channel for situating product decisions within operational realities and regulatory expectations. The council also functions as a risk-management and credibility tool: senior advisors can identify domain-specific threats, advise on mitigation requirements, and signal to government customers that deployments will be informed by experienced practitioners.</p>
        <p>Looking ahead, Anthropic says it will expand the council in line with the growth of its public-sector partnerships. The company expects the advisory body’s work to influence industry practices for responsible AI in government, including safety protocols and compliance expectations. As government contracts for advanced AI proliferate, the council could affect procurement criteria and implementation standards, while the degree of its influence will depend on how public agencies incorporate the council’s recommendations into acquisition and operational guidance.</p>
