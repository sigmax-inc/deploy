        <h1>Meta eyes Google and OpenAI models to boost apps before Llama</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/18610082/pexels-photo-18610082.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Meta eyes Google and OpenAI models to boost apps before Llama - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Meta’s senior AI executives have discussed using third-party models from Google and OpenAI inside Meta apps, according to recent reporting by The Information. The conversations involve Meta Superintelligence Labs and the company’s main chatbot, Meta AI, and extend to AI features across WhatsApp, Instagram and Facebook. Meta presented the approach as part of a broader strategy combining internal model development, partnerships and open sourcing.</p>
        <p>The Information reports that Meta considered integrating Google’s Gemini to provide advanced conversational, text-based responses for Meta AI. Leaders also discussed leveraging OpenAI’s models to power Meta AI and other features across its social platforms. Sources described these talks as tactical and likely temporary, intended to raise the sophistication of Meta’s public-facing AI products while internal models are further developed.</p>
        <p>Meta has signaled an internal focus on ensuring its next major base model, referred to as Llama 5, will be competitive with rival offerings. The discussions about external models are framed as interim measures to close capability gaps before that in-house model reaches parity. Internally, Meta already permits staff to use third-party models for some tools; employees can use Anthropic’s models in an internal coding assistant.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/24182512/pexels-photo-24182512.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Meta eyes Google and OpenAI models to boost apps before Llama - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>A Meta spokesperson told The Information, “We are taking an all-of-the-above approach to building the best AI products; and that includes building world-leading models ourselves, partnering with companies, as well as open sourcing technology.” The report notes that OpenAI, Google and Microsoft did not publicly respond to requests for comment about these discussions.</p>
        <p>The sequence described indicates a pragmatic shift in Meta’s deployment strategy: parallel investment in proprietary models coupled with selective external sourcing. Using external models can accelerate feature rollouts and improve immediate user-facing performance without delaying product timelines for internal model readiness. Meta’s internal use of Anthropic models suggests the company already accepts mixed sourcing for specific developer productivity tools.</p>
        <p>The arrangement raises structural questions about product differentiation, data governance and vendor dependence. Relying temporarily on competitors’ models could blur technical distinctions between platforms and complicate Meta’s control over model behavior. It may also require negotiated terms on data access, usage restrictions and deployment that differ from fully proprietary stacks, though the report does not detail contract terms or engineering architecture.</p>
        <p>For competitors and partners, the talks signal that capability gaps remain a commercial pressure point. Meta’s prioritization of Llama 5 indicates it views long-term strategic value in owning a competitive base model, while tolerating short-term reliance on external engines to maintain product competitiveness. The lack of public responses from Google, OpenAI and Microsoft leaves negotiation outcomes and commercial contours undisclosed.</p>
        <p>Near term, expect continued mixed sourcing inside Meta where third-party models provide immediate utility and internal development continues in parallel. The company’s public messaging frames this as an “all-of-the-above” approach, combining in-house model development, partnerships and open source, with Llama 5 positioned as the benchmark for future self-reliance. The Information’s reporting does not provide timelines or confirmed deals.</p>
