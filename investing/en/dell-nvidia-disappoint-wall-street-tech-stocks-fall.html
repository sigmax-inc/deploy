        <h1>Dell warns and Nvidia disappoints sending Wall Street tech stocks tumbling</h1>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/9539073/pexels-photo-9539073.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Dell warns and Nvidia disappoints sending Wall Street tech stocks tumbling - Image 1" loading="lazy">
        <p>Wall Street closed lower as heavy losses in technology stocks led by Dell Technologies and Nvidia dragged broader indexes from recent highs. The pullback intensified after quarterly reports and guidance that failed to fully satisfy investors’ expectations. The move left benchmark indexes off their record levels and highlighted sensitivity in market leadership concentrated in a few large-cap tech names.</p>
        <p>The sell-off accelerated after Dell reported a 10% year-over-year revenue increase and flagged continued AI server growth while issuing next-quarter revenue guidance that disappointed investors. Dell’s shares fell nearly 9%, the steepest decline among S&P 500 constituents, with market commentary citing concerns about margin pressure and weakening PC demand even though Dell beat analyst estimates on overall results.</p>
        <p>Nvidia also sold off despite a quarter that topped consensus; the company reported third-quarter revenue of $35.1 billion, with $30.8 billion coming from its Data Center segment. Shares declined more than 3% as investors digested data center revenue that, while substantial, fell short of the most optimistic forecasts. Reports also noted that ongoing geopolitical and regulatory risks related to China added further pressure on Nvidia’s stock.</p>
        <img src="https://images.pexels.com/photos/4581613/pexels-photo-4581613.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&h=650&w=940" alt="Dell warns and Nvidia disappoints sending Wall Street tech stocks tumbling - Image 2" loading="lazy">
        <p>Technology sector weakness pulled the S&P 500 down by about 0.8% and pushed the Nasdaq Composite approximately 1.2% lower. Those declines occurred against a backdrop of inflation data showing price increases holding steady and selective gains elsewhere, notably in healthcare. Market breadth narrowed as losses concentrated in high-growth, AI-exposed names.</p>
        <p>The sequence of moves was driven primarily by corporate news flow and positioning. Dell’s guidance recalibration appeared to prompt re-evaluation of near-term margins and hardware demand, which in turn affected sentiment toward other firms linked to AI-driven server demand. Nvidia’s results reinforced sensitivity to top-line beats versus the most optimistic projections and to external risks that could affect sales or supply chains.</p>
        <p>Structurally, the episode underlines two market dynamics. First, a small group of large-cap technology firms now exerts outsize influence on headline index moves, so earnings or guidance swings at those companies can disproportionately move the market. Second, investor expectations for sustained AI-related revenue growth are high and depend on forward-looking signals such as guidance and data center demand rather than current-quarter beats alone.</p>
        <p>Market behavior also reflected positioning ahead of a long holiday weekend and a sequence of mixed economic data that encouraged profit-taking and risk aversion. Traders reduced exposure to names where future growth and margin trajectories appeared less certain, favoring sectors perceived as more defensive or less exposed to geopolitical uncertainty.</p>
        <p>Near term, volatility is likely to persist around earnings releases and any developments affecting demand for data center equipment or regulatory relations with China. Investors will monitor guidance from major tech suppliers and further updates on inflation and macro indicators that influence risk appetite. The recent episode demonstrates that strong headline revenues do not remove investor focus on forward guidance and external geopolitical risks.</p>
        <p>The tech-led setback reduced market momentum but did not erase recent gains across broader indices. It did, however, illuminate how reliance on AI-driven growth narratives and concentrated market leadership can produce abrupt re-pricing when forward signals fall short of investors’ elevated expectations.</p>
